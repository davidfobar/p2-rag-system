# Writing Basic Tests with C++ with GTest

Writing Basic Tests with C++ with GTest
***************************************

Starting point: we'll assume you have a basic ament_cmake package set
up already and you want to add some tests to it.

In this tutorial, we'll be using gtest.

Package Setup
=============

Source Code
-----------

We'll start off with our code in a file called
"test/tutorial_test.cpp"

   #include <gtest/gtest.h>

   TEST(package_name, a_first_test)
   {
     ASSERT_EQ(4, 2 + 2);
   }

   int main(int argc, char ** argv)
   {
     testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
     return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
   }

package.xml
-----------

Add the following line to "package.xml"

   <test_depend>ament_cmake_gtest</test_depend>

CMakeLists.txt
--------------

   if(BUILD_TESTING)
     find_package(ament_cmake_gtest REQUIRED)
     ament_add_gtest(${PROJECT_NAME}_tutorial_test test/tutorial_test.cpp)
     target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}_tutorial_test PUBLIC
       $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
       $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
     )
     # target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_tutorial_test name_of_local_library)
   endif()

The testing code is wrapped in the "if/endif" block to avoid building
tests where possible. "ament_add_gtest" functions much like
"add_executable" so you'll need to call "target_include_directories"
and "target_link_libraries" as you normally would. The
"target_link_libraries" call is shown commented out because
"name_of_local_library" is a placeholder, uncomment it and replace
"name_of_local_library" with the actual target name from your
"add_library()" call only if your tests depend on a library built in
this package.

Running Tests
=============

See the tutorial on how to run tests from the command line for more
information on running the tests and inspecting the test results.
