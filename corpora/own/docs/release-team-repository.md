This page explains the recommended method of hosting your release
repositories on ros2-gbp.

What is ROS 2 GBP?
==================

ros2-gbp is a GitHub organization that hosts the release repositories
for ROS packages. It also maintains a list of release teams, the list
of members per release team and the list of release repositories
maintained by the release teams in https://github.com/ros2-gbp/ros2
-gbp-github-org. Interactions with ros2-gbp-github-org are done
through raising GitHub issues. It is recommended that you request to
join a release team and set up a release repository early as it can
take some time for the ros2-gbp maintainers to respond to your
requests.

What is a release team?
=======================

A release team is a GitHub team that consists of a group of people who
are responsible for the release process of one or more repositories.
Release teams are often made up of an organization, a working group,
or even an individual, and are named after the team or group that they
represent. The list of release teams and their associated release
repositories are maintained at ros2-gbp-github-org.

**You must be a part of the release team that you are planning on
releasing the project for.** If you intend to release the repository
under an existing team, follow Join a release team. If you intend to
start a new team, follow Start a new release team.

Join a release team
-------------------

Fill the Update Release Team Membership issue issue template if a
release team already exists for your project but you are not part of
it.

Start a new release team
------------------------

If no release team exists for your project yet, fill out the New
Release Team issue issue template to request one be created.

What is a release repository?
=============================

A release repository is a repository that

* stores files generated from the release process, for the ROS
  buildfarm to use

* caches configurations from the release process to simplify
  subsequent releases of the repository in the future

Having a release repository separate from your source code repository
is a requirement for making a release in ROS 2.

Create a new release repository
-------------------------------

If your repository is new to the ROS community, you should first open
a pull request on ros/rosdistro adding a "source" entry for your
repository (e.g. https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/39513). The
review process for the rosdistro database will ensure your repository
and packages conform to the REP 144 package naming conventions and
other requirements before release. Once your package name has been
approved and merged, fill in the Add New Release Repositories issue
issue template if you don't have a release repo for your project yet.

What if my existing release repo isn't on ros2-gbp?
===================================================

Packages released before ros2-gbp existed may have their release
repositories hosted elsewhere. It is now strongly recommended for
release repositories to live in this dedicated GitHub organization. If
you are porting a ROS 1 package to ROS 2 and planning on releasing
your packages into ROS 2 for the first time, follow standard procedure
to request for a new release repository for your ROS 2 releases. If
you have previously released your packages for ROS 2, when raising the
Add New Release Repositories issue, **specify your current release
repository url**, and follow standard procedure for the rest.

Note:

  **When releasing your packages into the Rolling distribution, you
  must use a release repository hosted in the ros2-gbp organization**.
  Release repositories hosted elsewhere are still supported for stable
  distributions if you are not planning to release the repository into
  Rolling. Since stable distributions created from Rolling will start
  with release repositories in the ros2-gbp organization it is
  recommend that you use the ros2-gbp release repositories for all ROS
  2 distributions to avoid fragmenting the release information.A
  ros2-gbp release repository may become a hard requirement for all
  distros in the future and maintaining a single release repository
  for all ROS 2 distributions simplifies the maintenance of releases
  for both the Rolling distribution maintainers and package
  maintainers.
